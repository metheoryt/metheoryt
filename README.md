- 👋 Hi, I’m @metheoryt, or Maxim on human's. The nickname is an anagram of 2 most influenced albums of my life - Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory and Meteora. 
I'm experienced in web backends and web security, Python 3 is my main tool.
- 👀 I’m interested in building new things and taking inspiring challenges, also to produce and adapt ideas on how to automate all the things, how to make them just work fine
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Clouds, like AWS and stuff
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that could improve my skills and bring some joy! 
- 📫 You can reach me as @cyphy in Telegram
